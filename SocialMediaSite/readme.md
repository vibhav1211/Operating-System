how to run the program: 
    - go into the directory where main.cpp is present
    - run make app 
    - run ./main 
    - for verification of result purpose run make verify 

things which are left to do: 
    - implement the priority mechanism 
    - make logging more visually appealing 
    - implement 10 queues for each readPost thread so share the overload 
    - see how can you optimise the runtime more 
    - clean and organise the code
